LeakLog 💧

A leak detection job documentation web app

LeakLog is a lightweight web application built to document leak detection jobs clearly and consistently. It provides a focused interface for recording inspection details, notes, and findings, helping technicians keep job documentation organized and easy to review.

This project is currently scoped specifically for leak detection workflows.

🧭 Why LeakLog

Leak detection jobs often require quick documentation under time pressure. Notes, photos, and details are commonly spread across phones, paper, or multiple apps.

LeakLog was created to:

centralize job documentation

reduce missed details

provide consistent, review-ready records

The goal is not to overcomplicate the workflow, but to support how technicians actually work in the field.
